# sir-branching-processes
An extension of the SIR model using Branching Processes. 

We model the spread of an infection through a population with two types of individuals: those with a high number of social contacts and those with a low number of social contacts. The model is developed as a two-type Branching Process, and we perform both a mathematical analysis, and numerical and stochastic simulations.

The project was conducted as part of the course _Modeling in evolutionary ecology and epidemiology_ at the University of Vienna (2022-2023), and co-authored with Aäron Roex. It was advised by [Himani Sachdeva](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/person.html?id=110430) and [Jitka Polechová](https://mabshtml.univie.ac.at/polechova/).

This repository contains the report and the code written for the project.
